            <p>In Forest Hills, Queens, New York,Midtown High School student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz
                orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962), he is
                bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit
                and
                "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid". Along with heightened athletic
                abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for
                science,
                he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted
                barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as
                "Spider-Man",
                becomes a novelty television star. However, "He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief,
                [and]
                his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle
                Ben."
                Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, "With great
                power
                there must also come—great responsibility!".</p>

        <p>Anthony Edward Stark is the son of wealthy industrialist and head of Stark Industries, Howard Stark, and
            Maria Stark. A boy genius, he enters MIT at the age of 15 to study engineering and later receives master's
            degrees in engineering and physics.Stark is injured by a booby trap and captured by enemy forces led by
            Wong-Chu. In secret, Stark and Yinsen use the workshop to design and construct a suit of powered armor,
            which Stark uses to escape. Back home, Stark discovers that the shrapnel fragment lodged in his chest cannot
            be removed without killing him, and he is forced to wear the armor's chestplate beneath his clothes to act
            as a regulator for his heart. He must recharge the chestplate every day or else risk the shrapnel killing
            him. The cover story that Stark tells the news media and general public is that Iron Man is his robotic
            personal bodyguard, and corporate mascot. To that end, Iron Man fights threats to his company (e.g.,
            Communist opponents Black Widow, the Crimson Dynamo, and the Titanium Man), as well as independent villains
            like the Mandarin (who becomes his greatest enemy). No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man, as he
            cultivates a strong public image of being a rich playboy and industrialist. Two notable members of the
            series' supporting cast, at this point, are his personal chauffeur Harold "Happy" Hogan, and secretary
            Virginia "Pepper" Potts—to both of whom he eventually reveals his dual identity. Meanwhile,
            James Rhodes finds his own niche as Stark's personal pilot, ultimately revealing himself to be a man of
            extraordinary skill and daring in his own right.</p>

        <p>Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City
            socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of
            eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a
            movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in
            intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be
            enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike
            terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ..." As if responding to his
            desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.</p>
